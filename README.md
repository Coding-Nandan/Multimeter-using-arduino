# Multimeter-using-arduino

  Arduino LCD Shield MULTIMETER
  
  You must have had problems with your Electrical components whether they worked or not,
  for example couple of days back I did an arduino project but it was not working I spent
  the next few days rebuilding the project using new parts until I found  that it was the
  problem of 1 JUMPER WIRE!! the whole circuit did not run.(I had many problems like these)
  Then I knew I had to do something to check other components as well,so I came up with 
  this design which has functions that a normal multimeter does not have..This multimeter
  which you can make for a couple of bucks can check: connectivity,voltage,resistance,
  has a built in servo tester,LED tester and motor tester as well .This project can 
  accurately measure and display the accurate results obtained after the internal
  calculations.This multimeter has a menu system to change to the mode of electronic
  components and run through them.

  I hope you will learn something by building this project and never experience the same issues like me.
